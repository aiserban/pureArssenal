## What is it
An RSS reader built with Typescript and React Native. Proof of concept really.


## History
[The first attempt](https://github.com/aiserban/arssenal) at such a reader was with Expo & ReactNative. I ended up with a lot of effort spent  searching for Expo-compatible libraries, or doing a lot of mumbo-jumbo trying to make things work. For a tool made to simplify things, it created more problems than it solved.

## So what does it do?
Currently* it fetches some (hardcoded) feeds. You can see the list of items retrieved, sorted by date & time. Tap on any one of them to open the link in a WebView. The item becomes 'read' at the same time and it persists throughout the session (no real backend)

\* Readme might be out of date

## Pics?
